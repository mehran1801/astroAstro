- Copied the common data and put it into the layout (Base layout)
- Changed the title on all the pages using Props
- Made the markdown pages, and learnt why to create separate layout
- Component will have different object(Astro . props) but in markdownit is slightly different (Astro . props . content).
- Astro uses a code fence (---) to identify the component script in your Astro component. 
- Head component is merged into Base component so I figured out how to use title property value, as you can see all pages have 
    different title values.
- When you place a style tag inside of an Astro component, Astro will detect the CSS and handle your styles for you, automatically.
- If same property and value, then there is shortcut way to define.just like this     title}
- How can you write some markdown in your component (import markdown from)
